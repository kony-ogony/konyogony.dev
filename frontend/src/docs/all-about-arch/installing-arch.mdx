# Installing Arch

In this guide I will show and teach you how to install Arch from scratch on your machine **with dualboot**.
I will try to be as simple as possible, while also providing good info. If I am wrong or you found a mistake [contact me](https://localhost/docs/about#contacting-me).

## 1. Getting Arch .ISO file

Firstly you should download Arch .ISO file from their [official website](https://archlinux.org/download/). Scroll down until you find your country and download it from there.
Once you have the .ISO file move it other to your media. I recommend using a tool like [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/en/download.html) - it helps you managing multiple ISO files stored on your storage without the need of Rufus.

## 2. Booting into media

After getting the .ISO file onto your media restart your device and repeatedly hit `DEL` or `HOME` key on keyboard. This should boot you into your BIOS. Then navigate to the `BOOT` tab using arrow keys.
Once there, go down until you find your media device name. _Tip: It might include the word 'Ventoy' in the devices name_.
When you found it and using arrows keys selected it click `Enter` to boot into it.

After your pc has booted into Ventoy select `archlinux.iso` file and press enter to boot into it. It might ask you the mode to boot into, select normal and continue.

## 3. Getting Wi-Fi working

When you have successfully booted into Arch Linux installation tool you will have no inteernet connection if you are using Wi-Fi.
To solve this problem we would have to use `iwctl` tool. This tool from intel allows us to use wifi adapters to connect to wireless networks.
This is how it works:

```sh
# We first enter the tool:
iwctl

# Then we get device name using this command:
device list

# I will now reffer to this device as $DEVICE

# Now using that device name we scan for networks and get their names:
station $DEVICE scan
station $DEVICE get-networks

# Find your network name, I will now call it $NETWORKNAME

# After getting the network name we connect to it:
station $DEVICE connect "$NETWORKNAME"

# It might prompt you to enter the password, if so do it. Note: When you enter the password input might be invisible

# You should now be connected, to confirm this run:
station $DEVICE show
# Field 'state' needs to be 'connected'
```
